                        Welcome to GMEdd's interview with the one the only Ryan Cohen. I'm Joe Fonicello your host for
                        the
                        next hour.
                        Ryan serves as the chairman of GameStop and the manager of RC Ventures.
                        Ryan, this is your first public appearance in over two years and the only time you've sat down
                        with
                        anyone for an extended interview like this. Why have you remained so quiet despite the
                        attention?
                    </div>
                    <div class="speaker-name"> Ryan Cohen </div>
                    <div class="speaker-text">
                        Well first of all thank you for hosting me, I've been incredibly impressed with a level of
                        diligence
                        that GMEdd has done for GameStop and for the community and I couldn't think of a more
                        appropriate
                        channel to have this conversation with. Secondly in terms of why haven't I done anything up
                        until
                        now, I
                        haven't had time, I've been focused on work so. Sorry for my dog in the background, but I
                        haven't
                        had
                        time to play I've been focused on work, so it's taking up all of my time.

                    <div class="speaker-text"> Before everything with GameStop, you were the founder and CEO of Chewy at
                        the
                        age of 25. Can you
                        talk about what building Chewy meant to you and what you learned from that experience?
                    </div>
                    <div class="speaker-name"> Ryan Cohen </div>
                    <div class="speaker-text"> Can you hear the dog in the background? </div>

                    <div class="speaker-name"> Joe Fonicello </div>
                    <div class="speaker-text"> That's perfect. </div>
                    <div class="speaker-name"> Ryan Cohen </div>
                    <div class="speaker-text">
                        It's a real dog by the way it's not just sound effects.
                        What did I learn from Chewy? Chewy was hard. We built Chewy in Florida, it was very hard to
                        raise
                        capital, we we're a bunch of nobodies. It's like three states basically account for like 75
                        percent
                        of
                        venture capital: New York, California, and Massachusetts, so raising capital was really
                        difficult to
                        Chewy, attracting talent was very difficult to Chewy,
                        especially being in in Florida the talent pool was pretty limited and we were selling 30 pound
                        bags
                        of
                        pet food online and so that wasn't very popular either against the backdrop of pets.com, so,
                        first
                        everyone said pets you know this you can't make the unit Economics work selling 30 pound bags of
                        pet
                        food, and then once we had positive unit economics everyone said that Amazon was going to crush
                        us,
                        and
                        neither of those things were true. But it was very very tough It's a low margin business, part
                        of
                        the
                        secret sauce was just how we structured it, we had negative working capital, we took the
                        business
                        from
                        like 200 million to three and a half billion, we burned through less than 150 million of cash
                        even
                        though we accumulated significant losses, so, we turned our inventory over faster than our
                        payment
                        terms, but granted, going ahead to head against Amazon selling 30 pound bags of pet food in the
                        mail
                        -
                        tough business.
                        GameStop on the other hand, in many ways -- you know Chewy was like a new construction, we built
                        the
                        business from the ground up, knew the business inside and out, GameStop is different. We
                        inherited a
                        bunch of legacy everything, and under-investment across the entire business -- people, the
                        entire
                        technology stack, just decades of neglect and so it's hard to turn around a brick and mortar
                        retailer
                        that's under the kind of pressure that GameStop was and continues to be under, but that was also
                        part of
                        the attraction going into GameStop was that a transformation the likes of GameStop was was
                        really
                        unprecedented and I was motivated by that and, you know, similarly selling 30 pound bags of of
                        pet
                        food
                        in the mail was also very unpopular and we figured it out so, yeah, I like tough things. I don't
                        like to
                        make my life easy for whatever reason.

                    <div class="speaker-name"> Ryan Cohen </div>
                    <div class="speaker-text"> I invested in GameStop because I thought it was cheap I thought the
                        intrinsic
                        value of the business
                        was worth more than the price that I paid, there was a tremendous amount of skepticism around
                        GameStop
                        and those are the things that I like.
                        I like looking at things where no one is looking at them. Those are usually some of the best
                        opportunities.
                        And I'd say the opposite of that is IPOs where you know the animal spirits are out and
                        everyone's
                        kind
                        of standing in line trying to give them money -- GameStop was on the opposite end of that.
                        No one was interested in investing in GameStop at the time that I made the investment it was
                        hugely
                        unpopular and those are the things that attract my attention. I'm contrarian by nature and so it
                        was
                        a
                        pretty contrarian investment at the time. </div>

                    <div class="speaker-text"> Yeah there are some contrarians online, what did you know about the
                        enthusiasm from some retail
                        investors over GameStop on digital communities like Wallstreetbets?
                    </div>
                    <div class="speaker-name"> Ryan Cohen </div>
                    <div class="speaker-text"> I learned about, I mean I'd say I only really noticed that when I first
                        filed
                        my 13d -- I lost my
                        13d virginity in August of 2020. So I was a late bloomer, and that's when I noticed retail
                        activity.
                        And then when I filed subsequent amendments I noticed it, but it was something that snowballed
                        over
                        time
                        and it was impossible to predict frankly.
                        So obviously we know what happened, we know what happened afterwards in January, but you know I
                        learned
                        about it really when everyone else learned about it. </div>

                    <div class="speaker-text"> Yeah last we spoke you refer to the events of January 2021 as one of the
                        most
                        fascinating things
                        that has happened in the history of financial markets, and it was life-changing for us retail
                        investors.
                        What was it like for you?
                    </div>
                    <div class="speaker-name"> Ryan Cohen </div>
                    <div class="speaker-text"> I was, when I decided to join the board personally, I made a long-term
                        commitment to be at the
                        company for an extended period of time, and so there was a lot of deliberations or I'd say board
                        drama
                        going on after I joined the board that really had nothing to do with the volatility in the
                        markets
                        and
                        had everything to do just with the transformation and everything going on
                        at the company, and so we changed the composition of the board, we got rid of the entire board
                        we
                        got
                        rid of all the professional directors, we changed up the entire management team and so I was
                        just I
                        was
                        focused on making all of the changes at the company and that consumed all of my time. </div>

                        to
                        the company and, net I mean I think it was hugely hugely beneficial for the brand. </div>

                        Yeah I remember when that happened we made a post on GMEdd saying this is the
                        great opportunity to rebrand all the stores across the globe to GameStop because that was just
                        free
                        marketing you know for everyone to know the GameStop name and you did end up changing Canada
                        over to
                        GameStop.
                        So, founding a company poses a different set of challenges than transforming a legacy business.
                        How
                        are Chewy and GameStop different or alike?
                    </div>
                    <div class="speaker-name"> Ryan Cohen </div>
                    <div class="speaker-text"> They're both contrarian. Selling, -- you know there were all the
                        comparisons with Chewy to pets.com, and then GameStop to Blockbuster, it was harder to raise
                        capital at Chewy, it was you know every time we raised capital we basically had one option, when
                        we were hiring was very difficult we were unknown quantity in Florida, I'd say at GameStop you
                        know we've been able to raise capital, we're fortunate that we were able to do two ATMs, it's
                        been easier to hire, being in the public markets and having that level of visibility.
                        But in terms of the actual business that -- the business is more challenged at GameStop even if
                        you look at the the cohorts and the customer retention, at Chewy selling consumables online we
                        had really sticky customers and at GameStop it's completely completely different. You don't have
                        sticky customers, so you know we had a payback period and a certain lifetime value whereas at
                        GameStop you got to make back your money right away when you spend money on customer
                        acquisition, so it's definitely a different dynamic.
                        Having said that though, if you look at GameStop and the brand and you know the store base and
                        the strategic assets of the company, the size of the the customer database, you know there's a
                        lot of strategic and just the revenue base frankly, I mean we needed to build that revenue base
                        at Chewy, no one had ever heard of it, it was literally a customer by customer, whereas with
                        GameStop it's a known quantity already, and we've got a business and a foundation to build off
                        of, but having said that, it's a foundation that was under invested in for a very very long time
                        and we've been working really hard to restore and rebuild that foundation.</div>

                        whether or
                        not you would become
                        CEO, you were CEO at Chewy, why not at GameStop? Jim [Grube] and Alan [Attal] served as your CFO
                        and
                        COO, so we thought you were putting the Chewy team back together since they were placed on the
                        GameStop
                        board.

                        It, after -- Chewy almost killed me, so I didn't want to put myself in the same position in
                        terms of
                        just the the level of sacrifice that's required to be the CEO, having already done that is
                        something
                        that I didn't want to put myself in the same position. So I put myself in a position where I can
                        be
                        involved strategically, but not putting myself in a position where, you know, once once I'm CEO
                        --
                        with
                        Chewy, and I guess this is just my work ethic and the way that I am, I'll, you know, if I'm the
                        CEO
                        I'll
                        basically work myself to death, and I can't control myself, I'm an extremist, so I didn't want
                        to
                        put
                        myself in the same position. I learned my lesson after Chewy and that I have to control myself.
                        I'm
                        my

                    <div class="speaker-text"> I'm sick of seeing failed executives make millions in risk-free
                        compensation
                        while shareholders are
                        left holding the bag, and then you're asked “so how do you change it?” and you say directors
                        should
                        comprise of owners who bought shares with their own money.
                    </div>
                    <div class="speaker-name"> Ryan Cohen </div>
                    <div class="speaker-text"> Yeah I think that's the simple and most effective solution -- you've got
                        a
                        board room full of owners
                        that are risking their own capital, you tend to think differently when -- it's very very
                        different
                        when
                        something is given to you that's risk-free compensation and regardless of how the business does
                        you
                        end
                        up making money versus you actually bought shares with your own money and you serve on a board
                        and
                        so
                        you spend a lot more time on the actual business and business risks and how the business is
                        going to
                        allocate capital as opposed to everything in the name of corporate governance and hiring
                        compensation
                        consultants and overpaying executives. People behave differently when they're risking their own
                        capital.
                        So, that's what I think the solution is. </div>

                        the Twitter board
                        owning almost no shares of the company. How do you feel about that?

                    <div class="speaker-text"> I think that's par for the course I mean that's most public companies. I
                        think it's like less than
                        10 percent of CEOs ever even buy shares in the open markets so I mean there's relatively there's
                        very
                        few insider transactions. You've got, you've got directors and executives that are serving on
                        boards
                        and
                        they're very well to do and I always wonder what are they doing with their money? Like they're
                        working
                        at the company they're serving on the board of the company but then put their money into
                        something
                        else
                        and that doesn't that doesn't make very much sense to me, but again that's the way things are
                        right
                        now
                        that's the way things have always been, that's corporate America and it's frustrating. </div>

                        short you don't have to, and so you know I think that it should be the same rules that applies
                        to
                        short
                        sellers as people that have you know that are long certain positions, and yeah I think that

                        much
                        of a difference between being long or short a position but the disclosure requirements are

                    <div class="speaker-text">
                        I think we got here when we started loading up professional directors in corporate America and
                        they
                        started being responsible for shareholder money without risking their own and you know going and
                        hiring
                        compensation consultants and surrounding themselves with expensive lawyers and other consultants
                        and
                        they don't care about the money so they're going and they're overpaying for talent they're
                        overpaying
                        ultimately for everything because it's not their money, what do they give crap? So that's how,
                        you
                        know,
                        that's how we got here is you know you've got a bunch of professional directors serving on
                        boards of
                        most of these public companies and ultimately I think the solution is you got to put people in
                        the
                        boardroom that are risking their own capital and then they're going to act a lot more sensibly.
                        But
                        that's not the direction that we seem to be heading in we seem to be heading in the opposite
                        direction
                        and you know I think that, for you know, I think that directors and officers should, if they're
                        responsible for shareholder money they should be risking their own money and they should be
                        buying shares with their own money and you don't see enough of that you see very little of that
                        so,
                        I
                        don't like it. I don't like it one bit. </div>

                        even
                        when
                        he had a 102 fever or food poisoning and so he worked his butt off and there was no free lunch
                        in
                        life.
                        If the business did well he made money if it didn't then you know he had some years where he
                        lost
                        money.
                        In corporate America somehow you know you've got these executives that are making millions of
                        dollars or
                        tens of millions of dollars, they can drive the business to the ground and most of their
                        compensation is
                        risk-free and they don't work very hard frankly either I mean they're going and they're

                        littered with risk-free compensation and overpaid executives, and it's deeply deeply disturbing
                        to
                        see
                        what's going on and the level of wealth inequality in this country, so you know building Chewy I
                        was
                        risking my own capital, I didn't take a salary for a very long time, and the salary that I took
                        was
                        really really really small. It wasn't millions or tens of millions of dollars so, as an
                        entrepreneur, as
                        someone who grew up seeing a level of work ethic that's ultimate you know that's really
                        unmatched, I
                        don't understand what's going on in corporate America it's a whole other world it's like Loony
                        Toons,
                        it's some kind of fantasyland or sick dream or whatever but it just it doesn't make any sense to
                        me.
                        You
                        could basically -- you can lose a lot of money and still make a lot of money. You can lose
                        shareholder
                        money and still make a lot of money and it happens all the time. </div>

                        he's been doing it for a
                        heck of a long time and so you know when it comes to investing I learned a lot from my father. I
                        mean I
                        pretty much learned everything from my father, he was the one who introduced me to investing,
                        and
                        then I
                        kind of have a hybrid approach, I'm you know willing to go activist if the op -- and I'm ready
                        to go
                        activists if the opportunity is right, but if I could sit on my hands and invest in a great
                        business
                        with a competent management team the way that Warren Buffett does it and you know let your
                        capital
                        compound for you, then you know I'm pretty agnostic in terms of what the approach is, whether
                        it's
                        activism or passive investing and so anyway that was just me you know being me. </div>

                        I think the job of an elected official is to bring the country together, and that doesn't seem

                        is the less freedom
                        people have, and so yeah I'm in favor of the people having more freedom. I think that the
                        greatest
                        advances in society come from the private markets. And you know, I think that ultimately is
                        capitalism
                        and if you look at the level of innovation in this country, you know from the likes of the

                        companies as an example, I mean that is -- that's an American phenomenon and so I think in

                        much different than the
                        start of the year. How has your investment outlook and management philosophy changed as the
                        world
                        exits
                        the zero interest rate policy regime?
                    </div>

                    <div class="speaker-text">
                        Interest rates, you know, higher interest rates are a game changer, and so it changes
                        everything,
                        it's changed how we allocate a capital at GameStop and that's not just GameStop specific, it's
                        every
                        single business, I mean it's as simple as before, you had zero percent interest rates and so
                        there
                        really was no discount rate and the difference between long-term cash flows and short-term cash
                        flows
                        really there wasn't much of a difference. Now you have a real discount rate, you've got the
                        10-year
                        treasury north of four percent and so the value of short-term cash flows is much greater than
                        long-term
                        cash flows and as a result there's, you know at GameStop we've got -- we're targeting higher
                        returns
                        and
                        we're focused much more on short-term profitability as a result. And so, you know, we're cutting
                        expenses aggressively and we're going to continue to cut expenses aggressively and have much
                        more of
                        an
                        emphasis on short-term profitability and so, it's pretty simple. Interest rates are like gravity
                        and
                        you
                        know you've got a higher hurdle rate and effectively a much higher discount rate and so it's
                        just a
                        focus on profitability.

                        It did. I mean we raised 350 million dollars and we would have taken, you know a similar
                        approach,
                        you know we targeted a certain lifetime value and payback period at Chewy and that was under a
                        zero
                        percent interest rate environment and so we would have been, you know, our marketing spend was
                        efficient
                        but we would have been even more selective in terms of how many customers we acquired and
                        targeting
                        a
                        shorter payback period and, you know higher returns on invested capital ultimately, and that
                        likely
                        would have translated into lower revenue growth but you know ultimately you just, you know you
                        allocate
                        capital differently when interest rates are higher, you're targeting higher returns.

                        as a – there's not -- there's more red tape and bureaucracy to work through as a public company

                        more in generalities. My views of the business clearly changed, and I was highly critical of the
                        strategy and, you know, the strategy in the letter that I put out. In general it's rare to see a
                        company
                        go from aggressively repurchasing shares to losing a lot of money. And so, you know, when I saw
                        that,
                        and I saw the results, you know, my views changed of the business and ultimately I sold.

                        A lot. I spoke to my father a few hours a day so I don't even know where I would start. He would
                        get
                        a kick out of watching everything that's going on. So what would I say to him? What would I say
                        to
                        him
                        about what? We'd have a lot to talk about it would a very very long discussion and I really
                        wouldn't
                        know where to start.

                        I have a very similar sense of humor, and so I, get a kick out of seeing some of the content
                        that
                        gets posted online it -- it's good. It's very very very very good. And some of the content that

                        in terms of that of sense of humor. The more provocative the better. I told you I got a really
                        dark
                        sense of humor, and so after you know if it's a long stressful day there's nothing better than
                        seeing
                        some of the content that gets posted online. The memes -- you know me being a cross-dresser, in

                        of
                        I look I don't know I look pretty good in some of those. I like and retweet a few of those so I
                        don't
                        even recognize myself I'm like wow.
