                "On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the Investment Policy. The Board of Directors has
                delegated authority to manage the Company’s portfolio of securities investments to the Company’s
                Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Cohen, together with such
                assistants and management committees he may engage. The Company’s investments will be made in accordance
                with the guidelines set forth in the Investment Policy. The Board may also approve non-conforming
                investments and/or, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, modify the Investment Policy from
                time to time.

            </p>
            <p>
                Mr. Cohen directs the investment activity of the Company in public and private markets pursuant to
                authority granted by the Board of Directors. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk
                factors, Mr. Cohen, in his personal capacity or through affiliated investment vehicles, may at times
                invest in the same companies in which the Company invests. Such investments align the interests of the
                Company with the interests of related parties because it places the personal resources of Mr. Cohen at
                risk in substantially the same manner as the Company in connection with investment decisions made on
                behalf of the Company."

            <p>
                GameStop has announced a plan to raise $1.3 billion through a private offering of convertible notes that
                pay no interest and are due in 2030. These notes can be converted into GameStop stock under certain
                conditions, but do not cause immediate dilution. The company may also raise an additional $200 million
                if demand is strong. The money raised will be used for general business purposes, including the possible
                purchase of Bitcoin.

            </p>
            <p>The notes are being offered only to institutional investors and are not registered for sale to the
                public. Investors may respond to this move in different ways. Some may see it as a way for GameStop to
                gain financial flexibility without issuing new shares right away. Others may see risks, such as future
                dilution if the notes are converted, or concerns about the lack of detail on how the funds will be used.
