            <p>
                The <a [routerLink]="'/sneeze'">sneeze of January 2021</a> was a phenomenal and dramatic event that
                exposed a certain reality to the world that something about GME was amiss.
            </p>
            <p>On social media, the rising price of GME attracted attention towards GME, which created more interest in
                GME, which caused more buying of GME, which caused the market share price of GME to rapidly accelerate
                in a positive feedback loop.

            </p>
            <p>Wall Street panicked and took dramatic action to stop this from happening. Wall Street incumbents
                colluded to prevent retail investors from purchasing any more shares of GME. A multitude of brokerages
                disabled purchasing of shares of GME and other stocks, while allowing sales of GME.
                As many as 178 financial institutions in unison disabled investors from purchasing additional shares of
                GME.
                This went on for just long enough so that the incumbents could more favorably reposition themselves in
                this situation, and kill the momentum that was carrying the movement.</p>

            <p>What was happening then was the beginnings of an event that would have become MOASS.</p>
            <p>For GME short sellers, MOASS is a cataclysmic event that represents complete loss of everything, were it
                to occur. Naturally, short sellers do not want this event, however probable or improbable, to ever
                happen.</p>
            <!-- <p>The risk of a short squeeze continues to exist</p> -->
            <!-- <p>This is happening because large Wall Street incumbents with larges amounts of money placed very large
                bets on the outcome of GameStop going bankrupt.</p> -->
            <!-- <p>GameStop is at virtually zero risk of bankruptcy.</p> -->
            <p>Those that bet on GameStop's demise (and took other actions to help arrive at this outcome) are now faced
                with a bet on a company that has no real risk of further deterioration, but do not have the ability to
                close their bet.</p>
            <p>If any participant that is short on GME wants to close their position, it would require buying shares of
                GME at the current market price until their position is closed. This act of buying shares of GME at the
                market risks igniting MOASS from happening, and so there is no real way for them to exit their bet that
                allows for their continued existence.</p>
