            <p>The mainstream financial media often downplays <a [routerLink]="'/naked-short-selling'">naked short selling</a> or denies the existence entirely. Most
                of the time, this simply entails <i>never mentioning</i> naked short selling. If you never talk about
                it, it doesn't exist.
            </p>
            <p>Here is <a href="https://youtu.be/XpHcA8Y1mWI?t=94" target="_blank">
                    a video clip of Melissa Lee from CNBC accidentally blurting out "naked shorts, yeah"</a>, in a
                conversation
                regarding GME and other 'meme stocks' on June 4, 2021, followed by an awkward reaction that can be seen
                in the expression on
                her face.

                For a few seconds afterwards, Melissa Lee was receiving direction through her earpiece, and what she did next was pivot away from the term naked short selling and talked
                vaguely about short selling.
                If you weren't paying close attention, you might not even have realized that Melissa Lee just made a big
                mistake that caused CNBC to go in to damage control.

                    Here is a discussion about this incident on superstonk

                When CNBC uploaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOSZCL04YR0" target="_blank">this segment on
                    their official YouTube channel</a>, they titled the segment 'Yields tank and
                    market rallies to close
                    out the week following May jobs report', and the part about naked short selling and GameStop has been removed
                entirely.
            </p>
        
            <p>On June 9th, several days after Melissa Lee's accident, reacting to conversations online about the
                original incident, CNBC releases <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB43u38BV8o" target="_blank">
                    a segment specifically about naked short selling</a>.<br>
                In this segment, they confirm that naked short selling does happen, but that it is difficult to prove
                and the SEC has brought very few cases because it is time-consuming, unglamorous, and requires detailed
                trade records and cooperation from insiders.
                <br>
                While they acknowledge the general existence of naked short selling, and briefly mentioned GameStop in
                the discussion, at no point in the segment did they directly address any notion of naked short selling
                of GME stock.

            <!-- <p>A summary of CNBC addressing naked short selling pertaining to GME:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On June 4, 2021, Melissa Lee accidentally blurts out "naked shorts, yeah" in a conversation
                    pertaining to GME, and then quickly pivots the conversation
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            When CNBC uploaded their edition of this video on that day, it was titled 'Yields tank and
                            market rallies to close
                            out the week following May jobs report'

                        <li>
                            The section of the discussion about GME and naked short selling is completely removed from
                            the official upload

                    Five days later, reacting to ongoing conversations on social media about "naked shorts, yeah", CNBC
                    publishes a small segment specifically about naked short selling
        
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            In the segment, they confirm that naked short selling is a real and prevalent behavior in
                            the stock market
                            with a major lack of enforcement
                        </li>
                        <li>At no point in the segment do they address naked short selling of GME stock</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Following this incident, CNBC never again mentions the term 'naked short selling'</li>

                    Who benefits from denying or downplaying the existence of naked short selling?
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Certain Short-Sellers: Hedge funds or traders that engage in (or benefit from) naked short
                            selling have an incentive to deny or downplay its existence. If the practice is acknowledged and
                            regulated, their trading strategies could be curtailed.
                        </li>
                        <li>Market Makers: In some cases, market makers (who are allowed certain exemptions to facilitate
                            liquidity) might not want extra scrutiny. If regulators clamp down on naked short selling, it
                            could limit the flexibility they claim is needed to keep markets liquid.</li>
                        <li>Broker-Dealers Under the Spotlight: Brokerage firms that fail to diligently locate shares (or
                            turn a blind eye to naked short activities) can profit from the additional trading volume or
                            fees. Denying the problem reduces legal and regulatory pressure on them.</li>
                        <li>Regulators Avoiding Embarrassment: If widespread naked short selling is real, it suggests gaps
                            in regulation or enforcement. By minimizing its prevalence, regulators can sidestep questions
                            about why those gaps havenâ€™t been fixed.</li>
                        <li>Maintaining Public Confidence: Acknowledging rampant naked short selling can erode trust in the
                            stock market. By downplaying it, industry players and some commentators try to preserve the
                            image of a fair and orderly market.</li>
