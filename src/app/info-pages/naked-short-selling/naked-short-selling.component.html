                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What it is: Naked short selling is when a trader short-sells a stock without first borrowing the
                        shares (or even ensuring they can be borrowed). This means they sell shares they don’t actually
                        have.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Why they do it: Traders may attempt naked short selling to profit from a drop in a stock’s
                        price. It can be done quickly (and sometimes outside the rules) when they believe a stock price
                        is about to fall but don’t want to go through the process or expense of borrowing shares
                        properly.

                    </li>
                    <li>How they do it: By placing a short-sell order without locating or borrowing the shares
                        beforehand, relying on the idea that they can buy them back later at a cheaper price—or that the
                        trade will go unnoticed if not strictly regulated.
                    </li>
                    <li>Risks: If the stock price rises instead of falls, the trader faces potentially unlimited losses,
                        because there’s no limit to how high a stock can go—and they still have to buy shares to close
                        their short position.
                    </li>
                    <li>Regulation: In many markets, naked short selling is heavily restricted or outright illegal, as
                        it can distort stock prices and create excessive selling pressure, making markets appear more
                        volatile and less fair.

                Discussion online of naked short selling and GME
            </div>
            <p>Following the <a [routerLink]="'/sneeze'">Sneeze of January 2021</a>, many GME investors began to
                investigate and discuss what exactly was going on in the stock market to have caused this peculiar
                event.</p>
            <p>It didn't take very long for the hive mind to point towards naked short selling as one of the necessary
                culprits.
                After all, how could it be that the reported short interest of a stock could exceed the number of shares
                of that stock that officially exist? In the case of GME, in January 2021, analytics firm S3 Partners
                reported a short interest of 141%.
            </p>
            <p>During these social media discussions, there was often a great amount of doubt surrounding naked short
                selling; many social media users explicitly denied the existence of naked short selling.
            </p>
            <p> The very
                idea of naked short selling sounds absurd, selling something you don't have. Was it
                even a real thing? How prevalent was it in the stock market? To what degree was naked short selling
                involved in creating the conditions that led to the GME sneeze?</p>

            <div class="section-heading">"Naked shorts, yeah" - Media versus naked short selling</div>

            <p>The mainstream financial media often downplays naked short selling or denies the existence entirely. Most
                of the time, this simply entails <i>never mentioning</i> naked short selling. If you never talk about
                it, it doesn't exist.
            </p>
            <p>Here is <a href="https://youtu.be/XpHcA8Y1mWI?t=94" target="_blank">
                    a video clip of Melissa Lee from CNBC accidentally blurting out "naked shorts, yeah"</a>, in a
                conversation
                regarding GME and other 'meme stocks' on June 4, 2021, followed by an awkward reaction that can be seen
                in the expression on
                her face.

                For about 8 seconds afterwards, Melissa Lee was being provided instructions through her earpiece as to
                what to do next, and what she did next was pivot away from the term naked short selling and talked
                vaguely about short selling.
                If you weren't paying close attention, you might not even have realized that Melissa Lee just made a big
                mistake that caused CNBC to go in to damage control.

                    Here is a discussion about this incident on superstonk
                </a>
            </div>

            <p>
                When CNBC uploaded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOSZCL04YR0" target="_blank">this segment on
                    their official YouTube channel</a>, they titled the segment 'Yields tank and
                    market rallies to close
                    out the week following May jobs report', and the part about naked short selling and GameStop has been removed
                entirely.
            </p>

            <p>On June 9th, several days after Melissa Lee's accident, reacting to conversations online about the
                original incident, CNBC releases <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB43u38BV8o" target="_blank">
                    a segment specifically about naked short selling</a>.<br>
                In this segment, they confirm that naked short selling does happen, but that it is difficult to prove
                and the SEC has brought very few cases because it is time-consuming, unglamorous, and requires detailed
                trade records and cooperation from insiders.
                <br>
                While they acknowledge the general existence of naked short selling, and briefly mentioned GameStop in
                the discussion, at no point in the segment did they directly address any notion of naked short selling
                of GME stock.

                    23, 2021</a> from the

                        Wall St</a></i>, released March 3, 2022, in which a market participant admits to using naked
                short selling to make profits, and emphasizes that the problem is ubiquitous:

            </p>

            <p class="quote-section" style="display: block; line-height: 2.0;">
                "Folks I know who are still in the industry have been telling me, ‘I wouldn’t advise you to talk about
                it.’
                But I think they’re all living in a fake world. <br><b>I used to
                    illegally naked short sell stocks every day</b>. Every day. As long as I was collecting commissions.
                And the
                bank did not care.
                <br>The client sends an
                order
                electronically, and all you do is click on the order, go to execute; it’ll pull up a little box, you
                type in anything you want, and you just hit ‘OK.’ You don’t ask questions. You appreciate the order, and
                if that involves shorting a stock naked, you do it anyway. <br>Because management essentially tells you,
                ‘Just create the business. Anything on the back side, we will deal with.’ <br>So you’re collecting money
                on
                the front, you collect money on the back, and you actually have zero risk. The clients never see that.

                Who benefits from denying or downplaying the existence of naked short selling?
            </div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Certain Short-Sellers: Hedge funds or traders that engage in (or benefit from) naked short
                        selling have an incentive to deny or downplay its existence. If the practice is acknowledged and
                        regulated, their trading strategies could be curtailed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Market Makers: In some cases, market makers (who are allowed certain exemptions to facilitate
                        liquidity) might not want extra scrutiny. If regulators clamp down on naked short selling, it
                        could limit the flexibility they claim is needed to keep markets liquid.</li>
                    <li>Broker-Dealers Under the Spotlight: Brokerage firms that fail to diligently locate shares (or
                        turn a blind eye to naked short activities) can profit from the additional trading volume or
                        fees. Denying the problem reduces legal and regulatory pressure on them.</li>
                    <li>Regulators Avoiding Embarrassment: If widespread naked short selling is real, it suggests gaps
                        in regulation or enforcement. By minimizing its prevalence, regulators can sidestep questions
                        about why those gaps haven’t been fixed.</li>
                    <li>Maintaining Public Confidence: Acknowledging rampant naked short selling can erode trust in the
                        stock market. By downplaying it, industry players and some commentators try to preserve the
                        image of a fair and orderly market.</li>

                Naked short selling of GME stock
            </div>
            <p>Naked short selling is an open secret of the stock market.  It is real, it is prevalent, it is widely known about, yet rarely talked about in the mainstream media and enforcement against it rarely occurs. 

            </p>

            <p>It is difficult to prove because it is
                behavior that is perpetrated covertly by market participants that possess the ability to do so while
                evading detection and consequences.
            </p>

            <p>When GME shareholders began investigating the peculiarity of GME in the aftermath of the sneeze of
                January 2021, the
                discovery of naked short selling played an important role in investors' understanding of what is
                otherwise a mysterious and unclear story.
                Many GME shareholders continue to have the assumption that GME has been naked short sold to some extent,
                perhaps to
                a very large extent.
