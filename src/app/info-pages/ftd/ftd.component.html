            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>FTDs (fails-to-deliver) occur when a party in a stock transaction fails to deliver the security to
                    the buyer by the settlement date</li>
            </ul>

                Causes
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Short selling without borrowing: A trader sells a stock short without borrowing or locating shares
                    to deliver, leading to a failure to provide them when the buyer expects delivery.</li>
                <li>Administrative errors: Mistakes in processing trades, such as incorrect recording or communication
                    between brokers, can cause a failure to settle.</li>
                <li>Stock recall or unavailability: Borrowed shares are recalled by the lender, or shares are
                    unavailable for borrowing at settlement, causing a delivery failure.</li>
                <li>Insufficient inventory: The seller does not possess or cannot acquire the required securities due to
                    a shortage in the market.</li>
                <li>Market disruptions: Technical glitches, trading halts, or other unforeseen events can prevent timely
                    settlement of securities.</li>
            </ul>

                Persistent FTDs
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Indicators of market manipulation: Persistent FTDs may result from practices like <a [routerLink]="'/naked-short-selling'">naked short
                    selling</a>, where traders sell shares they haven't borrowed, artificially increasing supply and
                    pressuring the stock price downward.</li>
                <li>Liquidity and pricing issues: Ongoing FTDs can distort the true value of a security, creating supply
                    and demand imbalances that harm market stability and investor confidence.</li>
                <li>Regulatory concerns: Regulators often view persistent FTDs as red flags, investigating these
                    patterns to enforce compliance with trading rules and prevent market abuse.</li>
                <li>Impact on companies: Issuing companies may suffer from persistent FTDs due to depressed stock
                    prices, reduced investor confidence, and limited access to capital.</li>
                <li>Investor awareness: For investors, persistent FTDs can signal potential risks, manipulation, or
                    transparency issues in the trading of a specific security.</li>
            </ul>

                T+35 Settlement Cycle
            </div>
            <p>The <a [routerLink]="'/t-plus-35'">T+35 settlement cycle</a>:  SEC Rule 204 gives market participants—like market makers or authorized participants—up to 35 calendar days to deliver securities after a sale.  Various observations corroborate that this cycle can impact the price of a stock.</p>
