            Since 2021, GameStop has been undergoing a transformation: fewer stores, higher value, renewed profitability

            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>In the years preceding 2021, GameStop was a struggling company that was often viewed as <a

                        target="_blank">likely heading towards bankruptcy</a></li>
                <li>The company continues to close stores, reducing <a [routerLink]="'/stores'">store count</a> from
                    around 4,800 in 2020 to below 4,000 by the
                    end of 2024, focusing on fewer, more profitable locations</li>
                <li>CEO Ryan Cohen’s strategy emphasizes cost-cutting, profitability, and a selection of
                    higher-value items that align with GameStop’s trade-in model</li>
                <li>Although revenue has declined dramatically since 2018, GameStop achieved <a

                        for the first time in six years</a></li>
                <li>By raising nearly $3.5 billion from <a [routerLink]="'/2024-atms'">at-the-market offerings in
                        2024</a>, GameStop built a large cash position, earning interest income that helps offset
                    operating losses and sustain profitability</li>

            <div class="section-heading">
                Before 2021
            </div>
            <p>Prior to 2021, GameStop operated primarily as a brick-and-mortar retailer, relying heavily on physical
                game sales and a well-established trade-in model. While this approach had long been a cornerstone of its
                success and identity, the company’s digital presence remained relatively weak. As consumers increasingly
                embraced
                online shopping and digital downloads, GameStop struggled to adapt its traditional business model to a
                rapidly shifting marketplace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, these changes contributed to steadily eroding sales. The billions in revenue generated by a
                once-stable network of stores began to decline as both customers and the industry at large moved
                toward digital platforms, subscription services, and direct-to-consumer game distribution.

            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 further compounded these challenges.

                    target="_blank">Mandatory store closures</a>, reduced foot
                traffic, and widespread economic uncertainty put intense pressure on the company. As more people turned
                to digital purchases, GameStop’s limited e-commerce capabilities prevented it from fully
                capitalizing on the surge in gaming interest, ultimately deepening the difficulties it faced leading
                into its 2021 transformation efforts.

                Enter Ryan Cohen
            </div>
            <p>Activist investor Ryan Cohen became the largest individual shareholder of GameStop in the second half of
                2020 and wrote <a

                brick-and-mortar approach to a more
                technology-driven model.
                Ryan Cohen secured board seats and eventually ascended to the position of chairman of the board of
                directors in June 2021.
                Under his leadership, Cohen assembled a board aligned with his vision, aiming to modernize GameStop’s
                operations and reimagine its business as a digitally-focused enterprise.</p>

                <p>In <a [routerLink]="'/rc-interview'">a 2022 interview</a>, Cohen stated:</p>

            <p>Coinciding with the purchase of a large amount of shares by Ryan Cohen, in the second half of 2020 there
                was a social media movement growing around GME.</p>
            <p>Keith Gill, commonly known as Roaring Kitty or DeepFuckingValue, was somebody with great interest in
                GME stock starting in 2019. Although most people online were initially skeptical of an investment into a
                dying brick-and-mortar
                retail company, by late 2020 there was increasing interest in the contrarian GME investment among
                social media users whose views aligned with Keith Gill's.</p>
            <p>The momentum of this interest continued to increase and accelerate into January 2021, causing the price
                of GME stock to rise so dramatically that the stock brokers of Wall St decided on January 28 to prevent
                investors from buying additional shares of GME.</p>
            <p>This event played an important role in the turnaround of the company as it brought much attention and
                many new investors to GME who believed in the thesis of a long-term investment predicated on a
                successful turnaround.</p>

            <div class="section-heading">Turnaround Begins</div>
            <p>By June 2021, Ryan Cohen and the new board of directors were in the position to initiate the turnaround
                of the company. This has involved extensive cutting of costs, <a [routerLink]="'/stores'">closing of

            <p>GameStop has made substantial efforts to upgrade and modernize its online store and enhance its overall
                omnichannel
                experience. This has included investing in a more user-friendly and mobile-responsive website,
                streamlining the checkout process, and improving product availability and search functionality.
                Additionally, the company has integrated buy-online-pickup-in-store and same-day delivery options.

            <p>There is growing speculation that GameStop may be undergoing a significant transformation, though the

            </p>
            <p>
                While details remain scarce, GameStop’s leadership has consistently signaled that the company is
                positioning itself for a different future. Whether this
                transformation involves a deeper focus on technology, digital assets, or another industry altogether is
                uncertain. However, what is evident is that GameStop is no longer the same company it was just a few
                years ago.</p>
