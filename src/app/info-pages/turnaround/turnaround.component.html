            <ul>
                <li>In the years preceding 2021, GameStop was a struggling company that was often viewed as likely
                    heading towards bankruptcy</li>
                <li>The company continues to close stores, reducing <a [routerLink]="'/stores'">store count</a> from
                    around 4,800 in 2020 to below 4,000 by the
                    end of 2024, focusing on fewer, more profitable locations</li>
                <li>CEO Ryan Cohen’s strategy emphasizes cost-cutting, profitability, and a selection of
                    higher-value items that align with GameStop’s trade-in model</li>
                <li>Although revenue has declined dramatically since 2018, GameStop achieved <a

                        for the first time in six years</a></li>
                <li>By raising nearly $3.5 billion from <a [routerLink]="'/2024-atms'">at-the-market offerings in
                        2024</a>, GameStop built a large cash position, earning interest income that helps offset
                    operating losses and sustain profitability</li>
                <li>Core financial metrics show significant improvements to the company since the turnaround efforts
                    began</li>

            <p>GameStop has raised
                cash and eliminated practically all of the debt that it had. Now holding a large pile of cash, the

                GameStop continues to close more stores every year, a trend that began before the initiation of the
                company turnaround. As GameStop closes more stores, the <a [routerLink]="'/earnings'">revenue</a>

                    2025</a>, it
                states "GameStop is in the midst of a game-changing metamorphosis, transforming from old school into a
                modern company that is driven at its core by technology."</p>
            <p>
                It is evident that GameStop is already a different kind of company than it was just a few years ago.</p>
