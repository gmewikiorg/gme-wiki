            <ul>
                <li>GameStop's bottom line has increased possibly up to 500% year over year, with net income for the year
                    estimated at $50 M</li>
                <li>GameStop continues to close stores, which is shrinking the revenue base</li>
                <li>At the same time, GameStop continues to modernize and improve its business, making more effective
                    use of a smaller network of stores</li>
                <li>In terms of stockholders' equity, GameStop is now more valuable than at any time in the
                    company's history, at nearly $5 B</li>
                <!-- <li>? Financial media continues to demonstrate willful blindness towards GameStop's improving situation,
                    and instead chooses to paint a bleak picture about GameStop's outlook</li> -->

            <div class="section-heading">Operating Income: Still Negative</div>
            <p>GameStop continues to report operating losses. There are numerous factors that contribute to this,
                including an existing network of stores that remains too large and unprofitable, inflation and economic
                headwinds, as well as the continuation of the trend of customers buying video games digitally rather
                than physically. While we've seen reductions in operating losses over the last 5 years, it 
                demonstrates that the core business is still losing money.</p>
            <div *ngIf="isBrowser" class="chart-container">
                <div class="chart-title">GameStop operating income by fiscal year</div>

            </div>
            <p>Something else worth consideration is that GameStop is undergoing a transformation that aims to modernize
                the company and focus more on technology. While the specific details and goals of this transformation
                remain
                unclear with information that is publicly known, it can be assumed that the majority of expenses related
                to such transformation efforts would fall under operating expenses. In consideration of this, it could
                plausibly be the case that GameStop's core business isn't losing as much money as appears, rather, some
                unknown amount of these expenses are investments into a company transformation.</p>
            <p>In either case, GameStop's legacy business is either losing money, or barely breaking even at best.
                Regardless, GameStop finds itself in a financially strong position that allows for operating losses for
                the purpose of investing in transformative efforts.</p>

            <div class="section-heading">Interest Income: Carrying the Company</div>
            <p>In 2024 (and in 2021), GameStop was able to <a [routerLink]="'/2024-atms'">raise money by selling shares
                    at high market price</a>, and now holds over <b style="color:green;">$4.5 billion</b> in
                cash and
                equivalents, which is used to generate interest income. </p>
            <p>In fiscal year 2024, GameStop earned over <b style="color:green;">$160 million</b> in interest income, an
                amount that far exceeds all operating losses and other losses, ensuring
                net profitability for the company.</p>

            <div *ngIf="isBrowser" class="chart-container">
                <div class="chart-title">GameStop interest income by fiscal year</div>

            </div>
            <p>
                It is common for companies to have debt, and to pay the interest expense on that debt, and to report net
                interest expenses rather than net interest income. This was true of GameStop until it raised and
                continues to hold billions of dollars in cash.
                While it might be unusual for a publicly traded company to rely on interest income to offset operating
                losses, it is a strategy that has put GameStop into a strong financial position.

        <div class="page-section">
            <div class="section-heading">Net Income: Positive and Increasing</div>
            <p>In <a [routerLink]="'/fy23'">fiscal year 2023</a>, GameStop showed a return to net profitability for the
                first time in 6 years.</p>
            <p>Through 2024, among other things, GameStop closed stores, reduced liabilities, and raised cash, strengthening the financial
                position of the company.
            </p>
            <p>At the 2024 annual meeting, CEO Ryan Cohen stated that "we plan to continue reducing costs and focusing
                on profitability." </p>
            <p>All told, GameStop was able to significantly improve net income year over year, in line with the CEO's
                statements. GameStop now shows the highest net profitability since FY 16.</p>

            <p>By raising money from the market, GameStop has been able to pay down debts and other liabilities, and
                generate interest income.</p>
            <p>GameStop now has the largest value of assets that it has had in its history, as well as the lowest amount
                of liabilities over the last 20 years. </p>
            <p> In terms of stockholders' equity, this means GameStop is now more valuable than at any other time in the
                history of the company, at nearly <b style="color:green;">$5 billion</b>.</p>

        <div class="page-section">
            <div class="section-heading">Conclusion: Stronger than Ever</div>
            <p>
                GameStop has been undergoing <a [routerLink]="'/turnaround'">a turnaround</a> since the current
                leadership team took over in 2021, and we are now starting to see clearly some strong positive results from these turnaround efforts.
            </p>
            <p>Adapting to the modern video gaming era, GameStop's legacy business of brick and mortar retail stores continues to get smaller ever year, with
                fewer stores and reduced revenue.  Despite fewer stores and reduced revenue, the legacy business continues to be improved and modernized.</p>
            <p>Aside from GameStop's legacy business, the company has been able to strategically take advantage of
                market conditions and raise cash at various times.
                GameStop's pile of cash and equivalents is now worth more than the entirety of its legacy business.
            </p>
            <p>While GameStop's strategy may not be typical for a publicly traded company, it is a strategy that took a dying company and turned it into something more valuable than it has historically ever been.</p>
            <p>The company continues to face challenges and still has room for improvement.  What is demonstrated clearly from GameStop's fiscal year 2024 results, however, is that the company is strong and improving.</p>
