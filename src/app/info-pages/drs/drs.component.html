                    publicly traded companies in the United
                    States

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            As of 1998, Cede & Co. was the registered owner of 83% of all issued shares in the United
                            States
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Since 1998, this
                            ownership percentage has not been publicly released again
                        </li>
                        <li>When shares of a company are purchased at a stock broker, the buyer becomes a beneficial
                            owner of shares but holds only share entitlements. The registered holder of those
                            shares is Cede & Co.</li>
                        <li>Due to lack of transparency by Cede & Co. and the DTC, the number of share entitlements that
                            exist
                            among stock brokers and other market participants cannot be verified</li>

                <li>DRS is an acronym for Direct Registration System

                    <ul>
                        <li>DRS is a mechanism that enables investors to own and hold shares registered in their own
                            name on the issuing company's shareholder register, making the shareholder known to the
                            company</li>
                        <li>Moving shares to DRS removes Cede & Co's registered ownership of those shares, making the
                            investor the registered owner</li>
                        <li>
                            Holding shares in DRS form is the only way to have both ownership and possession of your

            <div class="section-heading">How to hold shares of GME in DRS form</div>
            <p>Owning directly registered shares of GME can be achieved mainly in 2 different ways. Each method is a
                2-step process.</p>

            <b>Method 1:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>An investor purchases shares of GME at a stock broker, for example Fidelity or IBKR
                </li>
                <li>The investor requests to the broker to transfer the shares to DRS</li>
            </ol>
            <p></p>

            <b>Method 2:</b>
            <ol>
                <li>An investor purchases shares of GME from GameStop's transfer agent Computershare
                </li>
                <li>The investor requests to Computershare to transfer their shares from Computershare's plan into DRS
                </li>

            <ul>
                <li>All shares held with GameStop's transfer agent Computershare are considered "registered",
                    which means that the individual investor is listed by name on the issuer's (GameStop's) stock
                    register
                    (also referred to as
                    the "ledger") and the investor is therefore known to the company.</li>
                <li>However, of registered shares, DRS is the only form that provides both ownership <i> and possession
                    </i> of shares</li>
                <li>Holding shares in Computershare's Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP) provides registered ownership
                    but not possession of shares</li>

                    In the aftermath of the <a [routerLink]="'/sneeze'">GME sneeze of January 2021</a>, GME investors
                    began to search for information to help make sense of what really happened and how the market
                    actually
                    functions
                </li>
                <li>Gathering largely on Reddit, several communities emerged, for example superstonk, where GME was the
                    central topic of conversation</li>
                <li> Through a series of discoveries and conversations, GME investors eventually learned
                    that DRS was the only way that an investor can obtain real ownership of the shares they paid for by
                    putting the registered ownership of the shares in their own name</li>
                <li>GME shareholders advocating for DRS have faced resistance and censorship on Reddit</li>
