        Discovery and journey of DRS by GME shareholders (summary timeline)
    </div>
    <p>
        In the aftermath of the <a [routerLink]="'/sneeze'">GME sneeze of January 2021</a>, GME shareholders
        began to search for information to help make sense of what really happened and how the market actually
        works.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through a series of discoveries and conversations, GME shareholders eventually learned
        that DRS was the only way that shareholders could take ownership of their shares away from the DTC and
        give it to themselves.

            GME investors discuss the concept of DRS. By the end of August 2021, despite a significant amount of
            opposition to the idea,
            GME shareholders began contacting their brokers and requesting that their shares be moved to DRS.
            <p>GME shareholders that had requested their shares be moved to DRS started obtaining access to their
                account with Computershare, and would <a

            GameStop reported financial results for Q3 2021, reporting
            for the first time the number of shares of GME that were directly registered:
            "as of October 30, 2021, 5.2 million shares of our Class A common stock were directly registered
            with our transfer agent, ComputerShare," representing 6.9% of all issued shares.

            <p>
                Up until this point, DRS was something that many GME shareholders were still skeptical of. When GameStop
                reported the numbers in their 10-Q filing,
                this was a demonstration to GME shareholders that putting their shares in DRS was a worthwhile
                endeavour, something that the company itself cared about enough to provide data about it.
