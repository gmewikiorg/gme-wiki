                Discovery and journey of DRS by GME shareholders
            </div>
            <p>
                In the aftermath of the <a [routerLink]="'/sneeze'">GME sneeze of January 2021</a>, GME shareholders
                began to search for information to help make sense of what really happened and how the market actually
                works.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through a series of discoveries and conversations, GME shareholders eventually learned
                that DRS was the only way that shareholders could take ownership of their shares away from the DTC and
                give it to themselves.

                    shareholders to directly register their shares with the company's transfer agent. "Move your

                    GME shareholders begin to move away from the r/WallStreetBets subreddit and eventually began using other

                        against Wall Street institutions.
                        The traders, initially focused on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum but now spread across discussion
                        boards, have changed how Wall Street analysts operate, causing major losses for some funds and

                    GameStop reported financial results for Q3 2021, reporting
                    for the first time the number of shares of GME that were directly registered:
                    "as of October 30, 2021, 5.2 million shares of our Class A common stock were directly registered
                    with our transfer agent, ComputerShare," representing 6.9% of all issued shares.

                        Up until this point, DRS was something that many GME shareholders were still skeptical of. When GameStop

                        this was a demonstration to GME shareholders that putting their shares in DRS was a worthwhile
                        endeavour, something that the company itself cared about enough to provide data about it.

                    <p>If a shareholder ever held any shares under "Plan Holdings" in their Computershare account, it would look
                        something like this:</p>
                    <img src="assets/drs/book-plan-holdings.png" class="image" alt="'Book' versus 'Plan'">
                    <p>
                        Shareholders are presented with two different share types, labelled as "Book", and "Plan Holdings". This
                        is confusing and ambiguous because "Book" is understood
                        to mean "<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bookentrysecurities.asp"
                            target="_blank">book-entry</a>",
                        which just means electronically recorded shares. However, since both "Book" share type and "Plan
                        Holdings"
                        share type are by definition book-entry shares, the labelling does not properly distinguish the
                        difference between these share types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If Computershare's choice of labels were more accurate, what shareholders would be presented with would
                        look more like this:

                    <p>When Ryan Cohen became The Book King ðŸ‘‘, many GME shareholders in places like r/superstonk believed that
                        Ryan Cohen was stating an endorsement of holding shares in DRS, aka "Book", and not DSPP, aka "Plan".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GME shareholders began to discuss the differences between the two disctinct types of holding, with the
                        general consensus being that holding shares under "Book" share type in their Computershare account was
                        the way.
        
                    </p>
        
                    <p>Curiously, in the weeks and months following The Book King message, these conversations slowly started
                        disappearing from superstonk.
                        The moderators there started <a
                            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/zolyun/comment/j0pnumn" target="_blank">
                            spamming their own template messages</a> into these conversations that were unnecessarily long and
                        confusing,
                        used out-of-date and ambiguous information,
                        and in general were against the community consensus,
                        suggesting that Plan Holdings were maybe even preferrable to holding in type Book.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The moderators there started restricting these conversations entirely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
        
                        Eventually, by around February 2023, the "Book versus Plan" conversations as they were <a

                    <p>This post contained newly found information which demonstrated that holding any shares in DSPP
                        exposes all DRS holdings to DSPP, and that to ensure all holdings are DRS, a shareholder must terminate

                        Some shareholders attempted to post this information in r/superstonk, but for some reason, the mods of
                        that
                        subreddit
                        evidently felt that this was not a subject of conversation that GME
                        shareholders should be allowed to talk about, and deliberately censored all attempts at sharing the
                        post.

                        This caused anger among GME shareholders against the moderators of r/superstonk, and created a
                        Streissand effect for the r/DRSyourGME subreddit,
                        causing the subscriber count of that subreddit
