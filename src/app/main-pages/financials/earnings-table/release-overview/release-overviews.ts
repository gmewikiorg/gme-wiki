We are proud of our team’s ability to quickly adapt to meet the increased demand for our product offerings.  As the pandemic spread, we leaned in on our upgraded omni-channel capabilities to fulfill customer orders through curbside pick-up where available, we reduced discretionary spending and enhanced our liquidity while continuing to advance our strategic priorities.  While we delivered a loss for the quarter in total, our performance included total sales just shy of our original expectations, even as stores closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and key video game titles shifted to the second and third quarters, exacerbating the headwind from operating in the final stage of a console cycle.  Even more impressive is that our e-commerce sales grew 519% in the first quarter and over 1,000% during the six weeks that our store base temporarily closed to customer access.  We believe this reflects the loyalty of the GameStop customer and the confidence they place in us as their preferred place to shop.” ',
            'Mr. Sherman, continued, “Importantly, we continued to make progress on our strategic initiatives.  We continued to optimize the core business operation and maintained financial strength and flexibility, recording a 43% decline in inventory and a 54% decrease in accounts payable compared to last year.  Additionally, we saw significant progress towards building a frictionless digital ecosystem as evidenced by our successful omni-channel activities, including improved fulfillment capabilities as we utilized our stores as distribution centers and for curbside pick-up, which in most cases supported same day delivery to the customer.”',
            'Mr. Sherman, concluded, “As we begin the second quarter, we are cautiously and prudently navigating the near-term, as we are operating in the last few months of the current generation console cycle and believe we have experienced a pull forward in demand for end-of-life inventory given a surge in gaming product demand following the global stay-at-home orders.  That said, we believe the performance we achieved despite multiple headwinds is further evidence of the power of GameStop and the advantages that we possess driven by our global footprint, knowledgeable sales associates and strong loyalty base.  We believe these attributes along with our intense focus on expense and working capital management have us poised to capitalize on the hardware and software sales growth expected as several new software titles and next generation consoles are introduced later this year.”     ',

The past year also saw us take steps to accelerate our de-densification efforts and streamline our store footprint, leverage our retail locations to provide same-day delivery and curbside pickups, and continue to enhance our suite of E-Commerce platforms. We also added important experience to our board by appointing several new directors with backgrounds in corporate finance, E-Commerce and technology and subsequently established a strategy-focused committee to accelerate our transformation.”',
            '“We are off to a strong start in 2021 as February comparable store sales increased 23%, led by continued strength in global hardware sales. As we look ahead, we are excited by the opportunities that are in front of us as we begin prioritizing long-term digital and E-Commerce initiatives while continuing to execute on our core business during this emerging console cycle. Our emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue,” Sherman concluded.',
