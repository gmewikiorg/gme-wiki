top comment says:  "Excellent post.  You'll probably get banned"

What does this say about the state of the community?


The reason is literally because it mentions mergers and towel stock (BBBY).



LAter in the day, WSJ announces that Ryan Cohen is being investigated by the SEC for a pump and dump.

a post is made in superstonk.
a post is made in PPShow, BBBY, and WallStreetBets subreddits.

the post in superstonk gets removed for rule 2:  not related to GME.  Huh?

For the next several hours, this post is gone off Superstonk.


Then, suddenly it's back.
Mod says:  "Sorry, with the flood of posts, we trimmed them too hard. Leaving this one up."


i call bullshit.  They removed the post because it was "not related to GME", it was about BBBY.  
This was their motivation and justification.

I think that they backtracked, realizing that it would be kind of inappropriate that
an apparent investigation into the executive chairman of GameStop is being discussed everywhere except the biggest subreddit of GameStop investors,
for the reason that the investigation is not specifically about GameStop.


Here is what I believe really happened:

Something related to Bed Bath and Beyond, and our chairman RC, is being talked about.  REMOVE THAT SHIT!  We don't talk about BBBY in this subreddit.
deleted.


this is how they behave all the time with stuff related to BBBY.  It was only after discussing among themselves did they realize they went to far.
Came back, restored the post, made up a bullshit reason:  "due to the flood of posts" yea bullshit.  They made a mistake and they came back to fix it when they realized they went too far.
