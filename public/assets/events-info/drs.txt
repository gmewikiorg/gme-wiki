HEY OP! I see you'd like to explore topic of BOOK & PLAN - we invite the community to assess, confirm or debunk these posts - especially being vigilant to the spread of misinformation.
PLEASE READ THE FULL POST - upvote it if you think other people should see it, downvote if you don’t.
If there’s wrong information in the post (remember: DRS’d CS shares are not lent out, DSPP shares are visible to the issuer and DRS'd shares are removed from CEDE & Co - the DTC nominee) leave a comment and let the OP know!
PLAN & BOOK: Understand the differences and similarities
Check out our megathread
It’s your choice how you choose to hold shares in Computershare (Both DSPP & DRS are ‘book entry’ means of holding shares), but there might be implications involved in the switch from Plan to Book - such as fractional shares being sold, and recurring buys shut off - so be sure to do your due diligence.
