https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/16ufib6/scc_update_post_9282023/

- It's the unfortunate reality that Reddit holds us to a higher standard against brigading than other subs. While you might have noticed evidence that other subs come here to be disruptive, they will face eventual consequences from Reddit -- our job is to keep Superstonk safe... and what that looks like is removing comments and posts directing Superstonkers to other subs. This is unfortunate, but it is our reality and it is beyond our control.

PP vs Kais vs Pulte drama.

https://www.reddit.com/r/gme_meltdown/comments/18yhzme/kais_openly_extorts_pp_over_the_trademark_of_his/

Some time ago, Kais went and trademarked the pp show, apparently on behalf of PP.  there was trust.
now suddenly, for reasons unclear, Kais is trying to extort PP, to get PP to "behave", to hold PP's trademark over his head and to do what Kais says.
Kais alleges that PP hurt Pulte somehow, which doesn't make a lot of sense.
Apparently it stems from the fact that PP said he doesn't want to do any more live shows (with or without Pulte) until he is made whole regarding BBBY.  Respectable position to be honest.  Why do more live shows just to have lost all our money?
Why is Kais trying so hard to assume control of something that does not belong to him?  this is not a way to make friends.

"My New Years Resolution is that @RyanCohen

however, things are starting to get a little too cozy with right wing.  trump supporters, Andrew Tate, etc.  in some ways it is starting to feel inappropriately political
