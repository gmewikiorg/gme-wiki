TL;DR: Recorded call with former Citadel client reveals Citadel has been underperforming and may have been cooking the books on their finances. Further evidence shows that Ken Griffin was desperate to hold onto his client's funds, and was ferocious towards anyone that left him.

Citadel under DOJ Investigation 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/17654wk/citadel_under_investigation_by_doj_that_was_mar/

"
The DoJ is not looking to "carry out justice" because justice in this case is a catch-22:

    Prosecute short sellers and you signal that every person with access to a broker that buying GME is a ticket to fortune = Exteme FOMO, bad idea.

    Prosecute and freeze GME from trading to resolve it through unprecedented legal means = US markets take a huge blow to their credibility for having to abandon market dynamics

    Don't prosecute and help them kick the can while keeping them on a tight leash = Best option
